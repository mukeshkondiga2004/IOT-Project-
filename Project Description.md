**IOT-Project** Unmanned Smart Parking System using IoT This project presents a fully automated smart parking system using IoT technology to efficiently manage vehicle parking without human intervention. It utilizes sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud connectivity to detect available slots, guide vehicles, and monitor the entire parking environment in real-time.

**Features** Automatic slot detection using ultrasonic/IR sensors

Real-time availability display via LCD or mobile/web app

Barrier gate control for entry/exit automation

Cloud data logging and remote monitoring (e.g., via Firebase, Blynk, or MQTT)

User-friendly interface for drivers (optional: web/mobile dashboard)

Low-cost and scalable design for smart cities

**Tech Stack** Hardware: Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32, IR/Ultrasonic Sensors, Servo motor

Software: C/C++ (Arduino IDE), MQTT/Blynk/Firebase, HTML (optional)

Communication: Wi-Fi enabled IoT module (e.g., ESP8266)

**Applications** Mall and office parking lots

University or hospital campuses

Residential complexes and gated communities
